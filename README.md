# IOT_Using_Google_Cloud
Industrial automation using google cloud.
we are going to control the robotic through the Google cloud and try to apply the google cloud various functions to perform various functions

## step 1
we are going to create a gcp IOT communication link between the raspberry pi and GCP console

## step 2
we are going to connect a robotic arm to the raspberry pi.

The following link can be found useful for connecting robotic arm to raspberry-pi.

## step 3
we are going to control the robotic arm through pub/sub and transferring messages through MQTT.

The connection log are proof that connection is established.
